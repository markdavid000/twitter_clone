Good evening guys, I want to thank you all for allowing me to speak in this tweeter space. My name's are, Mark-David Ojukwu and I want to talk about how my tech journey started. All thanks to my senior brother Casweeney Ojukwu who put me through this whole tech stuff and mentored me from the very beginning. Thou it's not like I can't do it on my own but with him, everything was made easy. So I started this whole tech stuff and coding on 01/05/2022 which was the past year, so from then till now I have learnt and achieved many things, but first, let me start with the things I have learnt. I have learnt many things from Udemy like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, I was about to learn React but my senior brother gave me tasks on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to clone the 4 unicorns of web2 so when am done with those tasks I will be looking forward to learning React. So that's all for the things I have learnt, now I want to talk about the things I have achieved in tech when I finished learning HTML and CSS I was given 4 websites including the Konga landing page to replicate which I did and I recently built a single page website with HTML and CSS which I was paid the sum #30k.
